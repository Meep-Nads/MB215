#Question 3. Letters before “m” in the alphabet and “m” or after

#Create a Python program with two distinct functions to count occurrences of letters in a string based on their position in the alphabet relative to the letter 'm'.
#Task Description:
#1.	Function count_before_m:
#o	This function will take a single string argument.
#o	It will return the count of all letters within the string that come before 'm' in the alphabet.
#2.	Function count_m_and_after:
#o	This function will also take a single string argument.
#o	It will return the count of all letters within the string that are 'm' or come after 'm' in the alphabet.
#3.	User Input:
#o	Prompt the user to enter a string.
#o	Ensure that the string is evaluated case-insensitively, meaning 'M' and 'm' are treated equally.
#4.	Output Display:
#o	Using the input string, call both functions and display the results.
#o	Show the user the count of letters before 'm' and the count of letters 'm' and after.
#Sample output:
#Please enter a string: Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes.

#Number of letters before 'm' in the alphabet: 24
#Number of letters 'm' or after in the alphabet: 2
